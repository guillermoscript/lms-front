# Build ChatGPT Apps with mcp-use

mcp-use is the full stack TypeScript framework for building MCP servers and MCP apps to plug-ins and Claude connectors

Use it to build fully typed MCP servers with tools, resources, prompts, 1 line oauth authentication adapters, middleware, production transports, a built-in Inspector, and headless tooling.

mcp-use has native first class support for MCP Apps with support for HMR both at the server and MCP App level to live preview the changes on clients like ChatGPT

## Get started

Follow the guides at <https://docs.mcp-use.com/v2>.

## API reference

Consult the TSDoc bundled in the installed package and the TypeScript source
comments on disk. Inspect the project's installed `mcp-use` version, generated
types, and existing ChatGPT-specific integrations before choosing APIs or
patterns.

## Agent Skills

Put reusable agent workflows in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; the directory is
served automatically, so normally omit the `skills` server option. Use
`skills: false` to disable it or `skills: { directory: "server-skills" }` to
override the project-relative directory. Keep supporting references, scripts,
templates, and assets in the skill instead of inflating tool descriptions.
