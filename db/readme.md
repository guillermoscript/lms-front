To run de db in you local supabase, you mus run the sql file in the db folder. 

```bash
tables.sql
```

```bash
sql-functions.sql
```

```bash
seed.sql
```

```bash
views.sql
```

You can do that on the supabase SQL editor. once you run the sql files, you will have a db with the tables, functions, seed data and views.
