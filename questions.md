i want to create a SAAS app, the idea of the app is to be a LMS where users can buy a subscription to have X amount of course or they can buy an individual course and have it forever, thats a basic requirment, im going to provide you with some SQL for the DB, i want you to improve the tables and also to be able have a great DB.
Im using supabase as BAAS and i want to use all of its features, like RLS, triggers, functions, etc.

this are the tables:


A table containing all accepted currencies.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS currencies
(
    code CHARACTER(3) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name CHARACTER VARYING(320) NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)

This table contains the billable entity that has subscriptions. If you are doing a B2B SAAS, these will be companies.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers
(
    id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name CHARACTER VARYING(320) NOT NULL,
    phone CHARACTER VARYING(32) NOT NULL,
    email CHARACTER VARYING(320) NOT NULL,
    currency CHARACTER(3) NOT NULL,
    address1 CHARACTER VARYING(255) NOT NULL,
    address2 CHARACTER VARYING(255),
    city CHARACTER VARYING(255) NOT NULL,
    postal_code CHARACTER VARYING(12) NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at timestamp with time zone,
    CONSTRAINT customer_currency_fkey FOREIGN KEY (currency)
        REFERENCES currencies (id) MATCH SIMPLE
        ON UPDATE NO ACTION
        ON DELETE RESTRICT
)

i also have this profile table that i dont know if sould mix with the customer, 
create table
  public.profiles (
    id uuid not null,
    updated_at timestamp with time zone null,
    username text null,
    full_name text null,

    constraint profiles_id_fkey foreign key (id) references auth.users (id),
    constraint username_length check ((char_length(username) >= 3))
  ) tablespace pg_default;

and in my auth schema im using the user table.
create table
  auth.users (

Represents anything your SAAS is selling. You might be confused by this table at first glance; but the rationale behind it is that it keeps the invoicing more flexible. If you, for instance, are selling subscriptions, and also maybe a physical product, then you will want to have these as seperate products so that each can be referenced on an invoice line. However, it adds some complexity as all plans will need to reference a product so that it can be added to an invoice line.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products
(
    id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name CHARACTER varying(255) NOT NULL,
    description CHARACTER varying(1000),
    created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at timestamp with time zone
)

This table contains the pricing of a product in a specific currency. It has a start and an end date. Only one price per product and currency is allowed in a specific date range. We prevent two active prices for a product, in the same currency, within the same date range with the constraint unique_price_in_interval.

Last but not least: the subscriptions table. This is the most complex table. It will contain all the necessary data to handle subscription upgrades, downgrades and canceling. Only one row with status ‘active’ per customer is allowed within a start-end timestamp interval. This prevents a customer from having two active subscriptions at the same time.

When a subscription is renewed for a another period, a new row is created in this table.

)


To accommodate the LMS component into your current model, you would need to add tables to manage courses, lessons, and specific roles such as teacher, customer, etc. Let me explain how this can be integrated while optimizing your current database structure.

**1. Refactor Existing Tables:**

- For `currencies`, `name` and `code` fields can be of type `TEXT` as they don't need varying characters and `TEXT` is typically more performant in PostgreSQL. `TEXT` and `VARCHAR` have essentially the same underlying implementation, but `VARCHAR(n)` has a performance overhead due to the length check.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS currencies (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    code CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

- `customers` table should reference `auth.users` as foreign keys instead of having separate fields for `phone` and `email` to ensure data integrity.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (
    -- ...
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users (id),
    -- Remove phone and email, use the ones in the users table instead.
    -- ...
);
```

The `profiles` table already references `auth.users`, so merging customers and profiles is unnecessary and could violate single responsibility principles. However, it makes sense to keep the `user_id` field connected to `auth.users`.

**2. Add LMS related tables:**

**Courses:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id BIGINT REFERENCES products (id),
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    thumbnail_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    published_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

**Lessons:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lessons (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    course_id BIGINT REFERENCES courses (id),
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT,
    video_url TEXT,
    sequence INT NOT NULL, -- Order of the lesson within a course
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

**Course Enrollment:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS course_enrollments (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    course_id BIGINT REFERENCES courses (id),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users (id),
    enrolled_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    progress INT DEFAULT 0, -- Store progress as a percentage or as completed lessons count
    completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

**Roles:**
Supabase uses Row Level Security (RLS), so you'd typically manage roles within the `auth.users` table and policies attached to other tables. You could define roles as a new type and add a column to `auth.users` or use the already existing `role` field.

**3. Implement Business Logic with Triggers, Functions, and RLS Policies:**

- Use triggers to update course progress when a lesson is completed or to insert related data into other tables when certain actions are taken.

Example of a trigger function to handle course completion:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_course_completion() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.progress = 100 THEN
    UPDATE course_enrollments SET completed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = NEW.id;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_course_completion
AFTER UPDATE OF progress ON course_enrollments
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (OLD.progress < NEW.progress)
EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_course_completion();
```

Apologies for the interruption. Let's continue with implementing RLS policies and discuss the integration of the customers and profiles tables within the app:

**Implementing RLS Policies:**
Row-Level Security (RLS) policies allow you to control access to rows in a table based on the user executing a query. This can be quite powerful in a SaaS application, where data access needs to be appropriately restricted.

Here's how you can create RLS policies for courses and lessons:

```sql
-- Enable RLS for the courses and lessons tables
ALTER TABLE courses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE lessons ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create RLS policy for accessing course information
CREATE POLICY select_courses ON courses FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (id IN (SELECT course_id FROM course_enrollments WHERE user_id = auth.uid()));

-- Create RLS policy for accessing lesson information
CREATE POLICY select_lessons ON lessons FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (course_id IN (SELECT course_id FROM course_enrollments WHERE user_id = auth.uid()));
```

These policies ensure that authenticated users can only select courses and lessons for which they are enrolled.

**Impact of Customers and Profiles Tables:**

In your application, `customers` can be viewed as entities responsible for payments and subscriptions, while `profiles` are more personal user information tied to an `auth.users` account.

Here's how they impact the app, particularly in a dashboard scenario:

1. **Dashboard for Course Creation (Teachers / Administrators):**
Teachers or users with administrative privileges would have access to a dashboard where they can create and manage courses.

- A user who creates a course could have a `teacher` or `creator` role.
- The `profiles` table can store display information, such as username, full name, and avatar.
- If necessary, you could extend `profiles` or `auth.users` to include a boolean flag or an additional role-based designation to indicate that a user is a teacher or admin.

2. **Dashboard for Course Consumer (Students / Customers):**
Students or customers access a dashboard where they can view the courses they are enrolled in, track their progress, and manage their subscriptions.

- Customers, in this case, would represent the link between the user and their billing details.
- The `profiles` table still stores the user’s display information, which is separate from the billing data stored in `customers`.
- The data model allows for flexibility where a single user can be both a customer (enrolled in some courses) and a teacher (creator of courses).

You would join the `profiles` or `auth.users` table with the `courses`, `lessons`, and `course_enrollments` tables to present the relevant data in the dashboard:
```sql
SELECT c.title, ce.progress
FROM courses c
JOIN course_enrollments ce ON ce.course_id = c.id
JOIN auth.users u ON ce.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.id = 'user-id-of-currently-authenticated-user';
```

This SQL query would retrieve courses and progress for the currently authenticated user, based on their user ID.

In summary, the setup allows for a clean separation of concerns, with `customers` handling everything related to billing, `profiles` handling display-oriented user information, and `auth.users` handling authentication and authorization.

**Possible Enhancements:**

1. If you need to manage different roles within your system (e.g., student, teacher, admin), consider creating a `roles` table and a user_roles join table to handle many-to-many relationships between `auth.users` and their roles.

2. You may want to track the history of course enrollments, cancellations, and completions. Incorporating a history log or audit table could provide valuable insights into user activities and course performance over time.

3. If you anticipate a large number of lessons per course or enrollments, consider indexing columns that are used often in joins and searches to improve query performance.

Remember that while designing your database

To properly implement your requirements, you will need a combination of database design modifications and business logic implementation (via application code, database functions, or triggers). Let’s step through the necessary changes and features:

**Database Enhancements for Role Management:**

Firstly, to handle different roles such as admin, teacher, and student, you can leverage PostgreSQL's role and inheritance features.

1. Create a separate table for roles, if not already present in Supabase's `auth` schema:

```sql
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('admin', 'teacher', 'student');

ALTER TABLE auth.users ADD COLUMN role user_role;
```

Next, ensure that users have a default role and create policies enforcing role-based access control:

```sql
ALTER TABLE auth.users ALTER COLUMN role SET DEFAULT 'student';

-- Alter existing RLS policies or create new ones according to the role
```

**Handling Courses and Lessons:**

2. Courses and Lessons tables are already described in your initial setup. Ensure they include necessary metadata to deliver your requirements.

**Implementing Role-Based Access Logic:**

3. Define RLS policies or application-level middleware to control access based on roles. For instance, ensure only teachers can create or edit courses they own and students can only access courses where they are enrolled.

**Subscription Expiry Notifications and Access Control:**

4. To send an email 2 days before a subscription expires, you would typically implement a scheduled job in your backend (or use an external service like cron-job.org).

Here's an outline of the steps:

a. Write a SQL query to select all subscriptions that are about to expire:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
WHERE status = 'active'
AND ends_at BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE AND CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '2 days';
```

Test this by creating a trigger or function that checks `ends_at` whenever the `subscriptions` table is updated.

b. Run the scheduler to execute this query daily. For each returned row, send an email to the corresponding user. This might be handled outside of the database in a service like Node.js with a scheduler like `node-cron` and an email library like `nodemailer`.

```javascript
cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', () => {
  // Code that checks for subscriptions about to expire and sends emails
});
```

5 & 6. Students who have an expired subscription or bought a course grant different types of access:

For students with a subscription:

```sql
-- Example of a policy for accessing an enrolled course with an active subscription
CREATE POLICY access_subscribed_courses
ON courses
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE subscriptions.customer_id = auth.uid()
    AND subscriptions.status = 'active'
    AND CURRENT_TIMESTAMP <= subscriptions.ends_at
  )
)
FOR SELECT TO student;
```

For students who have bought a course forever:

```sql
-- Example of a policy for accessing a purchased course
CREATE POLICY access_purchased_courses
ON courses
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM course_purchases
    WHERE course_purchases.customer_id = auth.uid()
  )
)
FOR SELECT TO student;
```

7. Track student progress within the `course_enrollments` table and use SQL queries to select progress information when required.

**Managing Tests and Submissions:**

8. Create tables for tests, questions, and submissions to manage tests.

Examples:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tests (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  course_id BIGINT REFERENCES courses(id),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_questions (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  test_id BIGINT REFERENCES tests(id),
  question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  question_type user_question_type, -- 'multiple_choice', 'true_false', 'fill_in'
  correct_answer TEXT,
   created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Define an ENUM for different question types
CREATE TYPE user_question_type AS ENUM ('multiple_choice', 'true_false', 'fill_in');

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_submissions (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  test_id BIGINT REFERENCES tests(id),
  submitted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS submission_answers (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  submission_id BIGINT REFERENCES test_submissions(id),
  question_id BIGINT REFERENCES test_questions(id),
  given_answer TEXT,
  is_correct BOOLEAN
);
```

9. A teacher can view student test submissions by querying the `test_submissions` and `submission_answers` tables. You should set up RLS policies to ensure that teachers can only see submissions for the courses they teach.

**Grading Tests:**

10. Teachers can grade the test submissions by updating `submission_answers` with correct or incorrect marks:

```sql
UPDATE submission_answers
SET is_correct = (given_answer = correct_answer)  -- This can be more complex depending on the type of question and possible answers
WHERE submission_id = 'submission_id_here';
```

The update statement will depend on how you structure your answers and grading logic. It may be necessarily more complex than the example given above.

**Implementing the Logic for Different Question Types:**

11. As you have different question types, you will have to implement logic for grading them, which can be simple boolean checks for `true_false` type, comparison to a stored correct answer for `multiple_choice`, or text pattern checks for `fill_in` question types.

**Example of RLS Policy for Teacher Access:**

```sql
-- Teachers can only edit courses they've created
CREATE POLICY update_course ON courses
FOR UPDATE TO teacher
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM course_creators
    WHERE course_creators.teacher_id = auth.uid()
    AND course_creators.course_id = courses.id
  )
);

-- Teachers can view the submitted tests for their courses
CREATE POLICY view_test_submissions ON test_submissions
FOR SELECT TO teacher
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM tests
    INNER JOIN courses ON tests.course_id = courses.id
    INNER JOIN course_creators ON course_creators.course_id = courses.id
    WHERE course_creators.teacher_id = auth.uid()
    AND test_submissions.test_id = tests.id
  )
);
```

**Automating Expirations and Notifications for Subscriptions:**

For scenarios such as expiring subscriptions and notifications, you'll likely need a combination of triggers, scheduled jobs, and external services to send the emails. For example, a scheduled job could run a query to identify expiring subscriptions, then use an API like SendGrid or Amazon SES to dispatch emails.

**Managing Access with Expired Subscriptions:**

For requirement 5, that students with expired subscriptions cannot access the courses they are enrolled in, you should have a check in your application logic that considers the `ends_at` of their subscription. If the current date is past this, then access to the course content should be denied.

**Remember:**

- Test your RLS policies thoroughly to ensure they enforce the access controls you require correctly.
- Grading tests and handling different kinds of answers might need complex application logic beyond what can be done in SQL.
- Notifications for expiring subscriptions would typically be best handled in your application code or through a serverless function that runs on a schedule and has the logic to check subscription status and integration with an email service.
- You may want to consider implementing idempotency in your subscription renewal process to handle any edge cases and ensure a smooth user experience.

<!-- 7. the plans could have a trial period of 7 days. -->
Certainly! The following is an example of a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to handling invoice activations that trigger the creation of subscription or course purchase records. This example assumes that your data model has the appropriate details for each purchase type.

First, expand the details in your existing tables:

```sql
-- Enhancing the `subscriptions` table to include more subscription details.
ALTER TABLE subscriptions
ADD COLUMN billing_interval INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 30, -- e.g., number of days for the subscription period
ADD COLUMN is_recurring BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE; -- e.g., whether the subscription should auto-renew

-- Enhancing `course_purchases` table with more details
ALTER TABLE course_purchases
ADD COLUMN price NUMERIC(12, 2) NOT NULL, -- the price paid for the course
ADD COLUMN currency_code CHARACTER(3) REFERENCES currencies(code); -- currency used for the purchase
```

Let’s define the trigger function with detailed error handling and rich data management:

```sql
-- This function handles creating subscriptions or course purchases when an invoice line item is marked as active.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_invoice_line_item_activation()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  v_plan_id BIGINT;
  v_course_id BIGINT;
BEGIN
  IF NEW.status = 'active' THEN
    -- Starting a savepoint for partial rollback in case of errors
    SAVEPOINT handle_activation;
    FOR record IN SELECT * FROM invoice_line_items WHERE invoice_id = NEW.id LOOP
      BEGIN
        -- Subscription handling
        IF record.item_type = 'subscription' THEN
          -- Assuming `product_id` here refers to a `plan_id`
          v_plan_id := record.product_id;
          
          -- Insert the subscription after checking if one doesn't already exist
          INSERT INTO subscriptions (customer_id, plan_id, invoice_id, starts_at, status, billing_interval, is_recurring)
          SELECT NEW.customer_id, v_plan_id, NEW.id, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'active', 30, TRUE
          WHERE NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM subscriptions WHERE customer_id = NEW.customer_id AND status = 'active'
          );

        -- Course purchase handling
        ELSIF record.item_type = 'course_purchase' THEN
          -- Extract `course_id` from `product_id` assuming a mapping exists
          v_course_id := record.product_id;
          
          -- Insert the course purchase after checking if one doesn't already exist
          INSERT INTO course_purchases (user_id, course_id, purchased_at, price, currency_code)
          VALUES (NEW.customer_id, v_course_id, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, record.unit_price, record.currency)
          WHERE NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM course_purchases WHERE user_id = NEW.customer_id AND course_id = v_course_id
          );
        
        -- Handle other item types if necessary
        ELSE
          -- Your error handling for unrecognized item types
          RAISE WARNING 'Unrecognized item type for invoice line item: %', record.item_type;
        END IF;
      EXCEPTION
        WHEN OTHERS THEN
          -- Here you would handle specific exceptions in a granular manner
          RAISE WARNING 'Error processing invoice item with ID %: %', record.id, SQLERRM;
          -- Rollback to the savepoint to allow other items to be processed
          ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT handle_activation;
      END;
    END LOOP;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Finally, create an invoice update trigger that calls your new function:

```sql
-- Trigger to call the function on invoice status update.
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trg_invoice_activation ON invoices;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_invoice_activation
AFTER UPDATE OF status ON invoices
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (OLD.status IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.status AND NEW.status = 'active')
EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_invoice_line_item_activation();
```

In this example, we've included:

- A loop that
